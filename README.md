I have scrapped and built a GUI using streamlit that should contain the feature to enter the keyword or Hashtag to be searched, select the date range and limit the tweet count need to be scraped. After scraping, the data needs to be displayed in the page and need a button to upload the data into Database and download the data into csv and json format.
